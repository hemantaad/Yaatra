                    converted to become Yaatra.</p>

            <p>April 2018- Yaatra app was launched. The mobile app was a catalyst in writing the success story of this
                ticket booking chain start-up that was to follow. It is a user-friendly app that helps customers to book
                tickets
                directly. Yaatra, by now had expanded to Pokhara, Dharan, Chitwan, Kakarvitta, Dang, Mahendranagar and
                was spreading at a massive
                pace. It has almost come up to 2000 Tourist Buses, 20,000 micros and 100 flights in Nepal</p>
            <p>
                July 2019- Yaatra bagged $100 million in Series C Round of funding from Japanese investor SoftBank. This
                year proved to be a financially fulfilling year. Yaatra now had the backing of one of the most prominent
                and powerful investors in the world.</p>
            <p><b>Conquering the Asian Territory and Stepping into the International Markets</b></p>
            <p>2020- This is the year that marked the establishment of the Yaatra empire in Asia-Pacific and
                kick-started
                international proliferation by establishing operations in UK, UAE, Dubai, China, Singapore and
                Indonesia. It also became a unicorn in September when it raised funding of $800 million from SoftBank

                extent it has. Today it has more than 330,000 Tourist Bus in 500 cities globally. And <b>Adhikari</b>,
